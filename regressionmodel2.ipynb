In machine learning, the term parameters refers to values that can be determined from data; values that you specify to affect the behavior of a training algorithm are more correctly referred to as hyperparameters.\n","\n","The specific hyperparameters for an estimator vary based on the algorithm that the estimator encapsulates.

These enable us to define a set of preprocessing steps that end with an algorithm. You can then fit the entire pipeline to the data, so that the model encapsulates all of the preprocessing steps as well as the regression algorithm. This is useful, because when we want to use the model to predict values from new data, we need to apply the same transformations (based on the same statistical distributions and category encodings used with the training data).\n","\n","Note: The term pipeline is used extensively in machine learning, often to mean very different things!
